        The next few sections of my report involve the organisation, manipulation and interpretation of the data set containing the related information. I intend to represent the data in ways such that I will be able to notice the specific relations and details of the original data. These sections contain the original data represented primarily in the form of graphs, so that further discussion can be made about what can be learned from the representations.

<p class="heading" id="cleansing">Removing Outliers and Blanks</p>
<p class="text">
        Some people indicated having less than 5 hours of sleep, possibly suggesting they may make up for this lack of sleep with short naps during the day (assumption made due to the 50+ audience being the largest amount of people to choose this option). Due to this, the outlier was ignored to reduce bias and improve the accuracy of further data analysis. <br><br>
        In contrast, some people indicated getting 11+ hours of sleep regularly. Due to this amount being such an outlier, with significantly less people selecting this option – the records were removed containing this as to improve the quality of data used. <br><br>
        There were some records indicating 13+ hours were spent daily on a computer. Even though this may be feasible, due to the very small amount of people selecting this option – the outlier was removed from the data set.<br><br>
        In terms of removing unnecessary data, all data regarding the state and environment, and generation of people were ignored. This is because the variables of the hypothesis do not relate to these factors at all, the demographical factors of concern are only gender and age (apart from the information provided in their responses). Removing the unnecessary data helps make the data analysis stage easier, as all the data kept in the data set does relate to the study.<br><br>
        There were many blank values contained in the original data, being either the extreme low or high outliers for the data sets. As a result, all these blank values were removed to ensure the data used was accurate and didn’t contain unnecessary empty data.

<p class="heading" id="raw">First Analysis of Raw Data</p>
<p class="text">
<p class="text">
        I will be exploring how blue light exposure affects sleep and ultimately causes a variety of issues due to the supressed secretion of melatonin. The question I am ultimately aiming to answer is: Does blue light exposure indeed reduce sleep, and how does the impact alter based on varying demographics?

        This initial table of the data set helps gain a clear idea of the demographic and allows a basis to be formed for the further data analysis. As a result of the outlier and blanks removal process, we are left with only 3 blocks of time as shown above in Figure 1. Furthermore, the process of removing other fields such as location, environment and generation results in only gender and age being left.<br><br>
        The main age groups of concern are present, the study is not focusing on children or the older demographic (although the older demographic is represented through the 50+ column). This is an important factor to take note of, as the results produced as a part of this study are strictly in regards to this demographic – the results shouldn’t be generalised to account for other demographics.<br><br>
        As shown in the bottom total figures in Figure 1, it is evident that the study may have an element of bias due to the representation of each gender/age group. There are varying numbers representing each group, rather than the exact same amount of people for each group. The final result of this study must take into account the reality that there is bias in the original data, which can certainly translate to some bias in the output.
