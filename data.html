        The data used for this study satisfies the timeliness data integrity characteristic as the survey was conducted between Friday 24th March and Monday 27th March. Despite it being around 2 years old, there weren’t any major events at that particular timeframe which could have caused bias in this data which would’ve affected the integrity of it. <br><br>
        The data is also relevant, as it was collected for further research in similar relation to the purpose of this report. The survey conducted attained both quantitative and qualitative data regarding the affect of blue light on people’s lives, as well as the amount of sleep they get. <br><br>
        Although, this data may not fully satisfy the accuracy characteristic due to some weighting being conducted in order to estimate a slightly larger range of data. Despite this weighting however, the original data collected by individuals that took part in the survey is still authentic and accurate data which can be used as a part of this study.

<p class="text">
        This data did contain some outliers that had to be removed from the data set upon examination. Entries that said anything less than 5 hours for amount of time spent sleeping were disregarded, resulting in 564 entries being identified and removed from the data set. <br><br>
        The data regarding the survey participant’s time spent on screens emitting blue light were also examined, however no specific outliers were identified and the data was left as is.

        A downloadable CSV file was not available for the data sets that were selected to be used as a part of this study. As a result, the data had to be entered into a CSV file so that later manipulation can be done by importing the CSV file into excel. In order to ensure that the data was accurate and did not change due to human-input fault, the CSV file was compared to the original data to ensure there were no differences in data. <br><br>
        I am confident about the security and integrity of this data that has been collected from the Lonergan Research report. Upon converting the data to a CSV file, I have ensured that a copy is stored both on a local hard drive as well as on Microsoft OneDrive in the cloud. The copy stored on the local hard drive is protected by the computer’s password, and the copy stored in the cloud is similarly protected by a password as well as Microsoft’s account protection measures. The copy of the data in the cloud will be actively used when manipulating data in order to draw further information and conclusions. If anything happens to that copy of the data, the backed-up data stored on the hard drive will be used instead.

        The data collected is in no breach of any legislation as the data was collected by participant’s that willingly chose to provide information. Anonymity is preserved within this data as no information is personally identifiable, and no medical data was collected and distributed within this data set. <br><br>
        No issue is brought up particularly with the Privacy Act 1988, simply because the data is anonymous and participants were notified with full disclosure of the data being collected and the purpose of the data. Similarly, the Health Records Act 2001 is not of concern in this case because there is no medical data and either way, no information is personally identifiable.
