Sleep is very important to everyone, and screens which emit blue light seem to be a factor that is a part of everyone’s daily lives. This resulted in my curiosity regarding how the use of screens emitting blue light could affect the amount and quality of sleep that people of varying ages get. Is there actually a correlation between exposure to blue light and sleep, or is it just a placebo effect?
<br><br>
I am curious about whether blue light exposure would impact sleep for everyone, or whether it would predominantly affect a specific demographic based on age or gender. I am eager to determine whether our society’s reliability upon devices emitting blue light are ultimately affecting our mental health through reduced amount and quality of sleep.

<p class="text">
Recent reports and research conducted by scientists leads to indeed confirm the correlation between exposure to blue light and sleep. A report by the Harvard Medical School leads to explain the situation in more detail. They state that the short wavelength of blue light affects melatonin levels which ultimately increases alertness and alters the body’s natural circadian rhythm. The implication of this is that people find themselves going to bed late and getting less sleep, as well as having far less REM sleep which results in less stimulation of the brain.

<p class="text">
I will be exploring how blue light exposure affects sleep and ultimately causes a variety of issues due to the supressed secretion of melatonin. The question I am ultimately aiming to answer is: Does blue light exposure indeed reduce sleep, and how does the impact alter based on varying demographics?

<p class="heading" id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</p>
<p class="text">
Exposure to blue light prior to sleep increases the likelihood of developing poor sleeping habits, causing worsened mental health and lack of energy due to the suppressed secretion of melatonin.

<p class="heading" id="scope">Scope of Study</p>
<p class="text">
This study is limited to a range of people selected to take part in the survey, totalling around 17000 participants. The distribution of ages and gender that took part in the survey are not perfectly equal, and thus may introduce some bias – which is ultimately a constraint of the study.

<p class="text">
The impact of blue light on sleep is based on healthy people without any illnesses that may introduce bias into the results.
