        In conclusion, the data collected and analysed acts as evidence which ultimately supports my original hypothesis made at the beginning of the study. Meaning the data suggests that exposure to blue light does correlate with sleep in a negative manner, and the data even proposes that the exposure also induces worsened health and wellbeing as mentioned in the hypothesis. <br><br>
        This study is not intended to purely prove that exposure to blue light is the only thing that has an impact on sleep, rather it is regarding whether it does in fact impact sleep in a negative way by reducing total sleep. It is beyond the scope of study to find specific factors of causation, but the scope takes into account the impact that other factors such as age and gender have upon blue light exposure’s impact on sleep.<br><br>
        The data analysis proved that age and gender do play a part in the impact, where some results varied on these factors. However, there were no ultimate themes these factors presented across all data analysis. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that age and gender do impact the correlation between blue light and sleep – although the specific impacts are quite small as detailed in the data analysis stage.<br><br>
        Ultimately, my study has shown that in the general case more blue light exposure results in less sleep and generally worse health and wellbeing. The hypothesis was successfully predicted, and the study has been able to answer the research question set at the start of the study.
