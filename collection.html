<p class="text">
        The following table shows all the variables used within the data set that is used as a part of this study. One point to note is although hours of sleep would generally be a numeric value, in this case the data was stored in a way which included characters (e.g. hrs and minutes) – Thus it’s datatype is a string.

<p class="text">
        The following table shows the file naming convention utilised as a measure of correct data file management, to ensure all versions of data were clearly differentiated via naming. This method allowed progression through the different stages of the data analysis process to be made simple and efficient.
